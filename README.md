# 3d-procedural-generation
although a lot of work is required on procedural generation, i wrote a draft about it. [procedural generation](https://gameidea.org/2023/12/11/3d-procedural-world-generation/) is the use of algorithms to achieve geometry. we use noises, and some real world variables such as moisture, winds and so on to place objects. for geometry, we use functions to construct geometry.
## todo
more research & details are required for draft to be considered complete. however, it does give some 101 info for now. see external helpful resources that i mentioned at the end.
